/**
 * The code we use here is the same as the {Challenge-1} but the difference we will use define
 *? So What is Define in C ?
 * In C, `#define` is a preprocessor directive that is used to define a constant or a macro substitution.
 *  It creates a macro, which is the association of an identifier or parameterized identifier with a token string.
 *  After the macro is defined, the compiler can substitute the token string for each occurrence of the identifier in the source fileÂ¹.

For example, if you have `#define MAXLINE 5000`,
 then every occurrence of `MAXLINE` in the source file will be replaced by `5000` during preprocessing.
  It's important to note that `#define` is a simple text substitution and has no type.

*! So Define is helping us not to go wrong while defining any constant
