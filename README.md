## How while loop works?
The while loop evaluates the testExpression inside the parentheses ().
If testExpression is true, statements inside the body of while loop are executed. Then, testExpression is evaluated again.
The process goes on until testExpression is evaluated to false.
If testExpression is false, the loop terminates (ends).
