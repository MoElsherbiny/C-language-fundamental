## C- Programming -Language

* C is a versatile programming language that was developed by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs in 1972. Its syntax is similar to other programming languages such as Java and C++, and it is widely used for developing operating systems, embedded systems, and software applications.

* C supports low-level programming features such as pointers and memory allocation, which make it ideal for systems programming. The standard library in C provides many built-in functions for common tasks such as input/output operations and string manipulation.

* C programs are compiled into machine code that can be executed directly by the computer's processor, making it a highly efficient programming language. Due to its efficiency and portability, many popular software applications have been written in C, including the Linux operating system and the Apache web server.

* Learning C is often recommended for aspiring programmers as it teaches fundamental concepts that are applicable to other programming languages as well. With its popularity remaining strong after nearly 50 years since its creation, it's clear that there is still a need for programmers skilled in the use of this powerful language today.

* Interestingly, C was invented to write an operating system called UNIX, and the language was formalized in 1988 by the American National Standard Institute (ANSI). The UNIX OS was entirely written in C, and today C is the most widely used and popular System Programming Language.

* In fact, most of the state-of-the-art software has been implemented using C, and today's most popular Linux OS and RDBMS MySQL have been written in C.

## #include <stdio.h>

* This is a preprocessor directive to include the header file "stdio.h" in a C program. The "stdio.h" header file provides declarations and definitions for input/output operations in C, such as functions like printf() and scanf().
* By including this header file, a C program can use these functions to perform input/output operations.


## "int" 
* is a keyword in C programming language that stands for integer. It is used to define variables or functions that will hold integer values.
* For example, "int x;" would define a variable named "x" that can hold an integer value.
